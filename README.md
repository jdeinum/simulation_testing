# Deterministic Simulation Testing

What and why.

# Goals

1. Combine deterministic simulation testing with a way of generating random
   seeds, maybe something like quickcheck?

# Non Goals

# Principles

1. Single thread execution
2. Replace external interfaces with internal ones.
3. Deterministic core
